## 1) Project Title

**Transfer Learning with TensorFlow/Keras â€” CIFAR-10 Classification Using Pretrained CNNs**

---

## 2) Problem Statement and Goal of Project

This project demonstrates **transfer learning** in TensorFlow/Keras by adapting a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) for CIFAR-10 image classification.
The goals are to:

* Leverage **ImageNet-trained models** (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50) as feature extractors.
* Implement both **frozen-base** feature extraction and **fine-tuning** strategies.
* Showcase best practices for efficiently adapting large models to smaller datasets.

---

## 3) Solution Approach

1. **Dataset Loading & Preprocessing**

   * CIFAR-10 loaded from `tf.keras.datasets`.
   * Pixel values normalized to `[0, 1]`.
   * Labels one-hot encoded with `tf.keras.utils.to_categorical`.

2. **Base Model Selection**

   * Pretrained model from `tf.keras.applications` with `imagenet` weights.
   * `include_top=False` to remove the original classifier.
   * Input resized to match the base model requirements.

3. **Custom Classifier Head**

   * `GlobalAveragePooling2D â†’ Dense(256, relu) â†’ Dense(10, softmax)`.
   * Designed to adapt ImageNet features to CIFAR-10 classes.

4. **Training Phases**

   * **Feature Extraction**: Base layers frozen, only new classifier layers trained.
   * **Fine-Tuning** (optional): Top layers of base model unfrozen, trained with a lower LR.

5. **Evaluation & Visualization**

   * Model summary printed to verify architecture and trainable parameters.
   * Optional plots for training history.

## 4) Technologies & Libraries

* **Python 3.x**
* **TensorFlow / Keras**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib** (for visualizations)

## 5) Description about Dataset

* **CIFAR-10**:

  * 60,000 images (32Ã—32 RGB), 10 classes.
  * Train: 50,000 images | Test: 10,000 images.
  * Classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.
* Preprocessing: normalization + one-hot encoding.

## 9) Additional Learnings / Reflections

* Freezing pretrained layers preserves valuable learned features.
* Fine-tuning selectively can further improve domain adaptation.
* Transfer learning enables strong performance on small datasets with reduced compute cost.
* This workflow is adaptable to any image classification task.
